## **What Information**
Your Visitors Need
Every sit has his target audience and before you start doing your sit you should know who is your target audience
that is mean Realistically, it is unlikely to be relevant to everyone. If your site
sells light bulbs, even though most people using a computer probably use light bulbs,
they are not likely to order them from someone in a different country.
Even if the site has a wide appeal, you can still think about the demographics of a sample of
the target audience. Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users.
To help determine why people are coming to your website.

## **Site Maps**

Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.
The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will
show how those pages can be grouped.
To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called card sorting.
This involves placing each piece of information that a visitor might need to know on a separate piece of paper and
then organizing the related information into groups. Each group relates to a page and,
on larger sites the, pages can in turn can be grouped together to create different sections of the
website.

## **WireFrames**
wire frams is  simple skech / abstract skech what i will put in my page i will made it befor i start doing my sit to help me know what i will do .

## **Visual hierarchy**

use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for : 

1. **Size** 
*Larger elements will grab users' attention first. For this reason it is a good idea to make headings
and key points relatively large*

2. **Color**

*Foreground and background color can draw attention to key messages. Brighter sections tend to draw users' attention first.*

3. **Style**   

*An element may be the same size and color as surrounding content but have a different style applied to it to make it stand out.*
