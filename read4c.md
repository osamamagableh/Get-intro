**Javascript**:*This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.*
**STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND EACH ONE STARTS ON A NEW LINE**:*A statement is an individual instruction that the computer should follow. Each one should start on a new line and end with a semicolon. This makes your code easier to read and follow,The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter when a step is over indicating that it should move to the next step.*

1. proprties: Properties describe characteristics of the current web page (such as the title of the page).
2. Methods : Methods perform tasks associated with the document currently loaded in the browser (such as getting information from a specified element or adding new content).
